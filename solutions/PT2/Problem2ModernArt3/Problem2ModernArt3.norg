* Observations:
** the MAXN = 300 indicates range DP or some higher complexity algorithm
** Entire algorithm depends on matching opening and closing tiles with the same number identification 
** matching greedily might not always be the best option => indication of depends
*** Evaluating Greedy Strategies:
**** Try to match colors from the leftmost and rightmost (match the first color 1 with the last color 1 and color everything in between in the canvas to that color
